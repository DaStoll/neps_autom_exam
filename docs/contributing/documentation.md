# Documentation

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/), more specifically [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for documentation.
Source files for the documentation are at [docs](docs) and configuration at  [mkdocs.yml](mkdocs.yml).

To build and view the documentation run

```bash
mkdocs build
mkdocs serve
```

and open the URL shown by the `mkdocs serve` command.
